Description
The demand for smart home systems has grown exponentially, driven by the need for enhanced convenience, security, and energy efficiency. However, the high cost and complexity of many smart home solutions can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project introduces a cost-effective and user-friendly smart home controller that leverages the DWIN HMI LCD display and ESP32 microcontroller to enable real-time monitoring and automation of household devices.
